      <li>Take the 1 full onion and chop it.</li>
      <li>Reserve it for the bolognese sauce.</li>
      <li>Take the other half onion and chop it.</li>
      <li>Reserve it for the bechamel sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Mince the garlic and reserve half of it for the bolognese and the other
        half for the bechamel sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a medium sized pan, add a bit of vegetal oil and saute the onions you
        reserved for the bolognese sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as the onions start to become transparent, add the minced garlic
        and let it start frying slightly.
      </li>
      <li>Add the ground beef and mix it so it can start cook evenly.</li>
      <li>Season it with salt, black pepper, paprika and fine herbs.</li>
      <li>Mix it to incorporate all the seasoning and the soy sauce.</li>
      <li>Mix it a bit more and close the pan with a lid.</li>
      <li>Let it cook in medium-low heat.</li>
      <li>
        While the ground beef is cooking, get another medium sized pan for the
        bechamel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the butter on medium flame until it melt and add the onion and
        garlic.
      </li>
      <li>Add the milk, the flour and a pinch of salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Mix everything and keep mixing until it thickens.</li>
      <li>
        Turn the flame to low and let the sauce cook for around 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and add half of the shredded provolone and the table
        cream and mix it.
      </li>
      <li>Let it rest.</li>
      <li>
        Check to see if the ground beef is properly cooked and if its water has
        evaporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced olives to the ground beef and mix it with everything.
      </li>
      <li>Add the tomato sauce, ketchup and mustard to the ground beef.</li>
      <li>Mix it and let it cooked for 3 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Let it rest.</li>
      <li>Pre-heat the oven for 10 minutes at 180ºC/356ºF.</li>
      <li>
        While the oven is pre-heating, grab a medium to big size baking sheet
        and let's start layering our lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start with a thin layer of our bolognese sauce covering all the sheet's
        surface.
      </li>
      <li>Follow with a layer of lasagna dough sheets.</li>
      <li>
        Next, add a new layer of bolognese sauce followed by a layer of bechamel
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Added a layer of ham followed by the mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Repeat the steps, adding lasagna dough sheets.</li>
      <li>
        Keep repeating the dough and sauces layers until you run out of
        mozzarella cheese or space, whichever comes first!
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, after the last layer of mozzarella, sprinkle a little bit of the
        provolone on top of your lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil and put it into the oven.
      </li>
      <li>Let it bake for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Take the lasagna out of the oven and take of the foil.</li>
      <li>
        Put it into the oven again and let it bake for 10 more minutes,
        uncovered.
      </li>
      <li>Turn of the oven and take the lasagna out of the oven.</li>
      <li>Let it rest for at least 30 minutes to an hour before serving.</li>

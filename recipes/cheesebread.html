        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 liter of Whole Milk</li>
          <li>1 spoon of salt</li>
          <li>1 cup of vegetable oil</li>
          <li>1 Kg of cassava starch</li>
          <li>7 eggs</li>
          <li>400g of shredded Minas Cheese or Mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, put all the whole milk and oil inside a big and wide pan and
            heat it until it comes to a boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat and add the cassava starch, mixing it until it
            becomes an incorporated dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the dough cool off completely and add the eggs one by one.
          </li>
          <li>Knead the dough so that the eggs can get mixed.</li>
          <li>And finally add all of the cheese and keep kneading it.</li>
          <li>Pre-heat the oven at 180ºC/356ºF for 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            While the oven is pre-heating, drip a bit of vegetable oil on your
            hands and take a spoonful of the dough, rolling it with your hands
            and shaping it into a ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the ball on a baking sheet and keep repeating the process until
            you have turned all the dough into cheese bread balls.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the oven properly heated, put the baking sheet inside the oven
            and let it bake for 35 to 45 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Do not open the oven during the first 30
            minutes!!
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternatively, if you don't want to bake all the cheese bread in one
            go, you can put the baking sheets in the freezer for 30 minutes so
            they can freeze individually and then store them frozen in plastic
            bags/containers for at least 3 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the the first 30 minutes of baking, keep checking the cheese
            bread every 5 minutes to see if they have a golden brown color.
          </li>
          <li>
            As soon as they get those golden brown color, turn off the oven and
            take the baking sheet off.
          </li>
          <li>Let the cheese bread rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
          <li><em>Enjoy!~</em></li>
